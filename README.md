Tech Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, MatPlotLib, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Splinter

Credits:
- Xpert Learning Assistant was used to identify code needed to extract data from all cells rather than only the first cell of a row - row_data = [cell.text for cell in row.find_all('td')]
- Worked with AskBCS Learning Assistant, Deborah Aina, to identify error with MatPlotLib. Error could not be resolved so I used Pands plot instead.

Data Analysis:

On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!

Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.

The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
